# Playlist Project Using HTML/CSS/JS

## Lesson 2.1: Introduction to Functions
**Objective**: Get started with the project, understand the inspiration behind it, and gather song data.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Setup**: Clone or Fork the [Starter Code](#link-to-starter-code).
- [ ] **Exploration**: Navigate to ‚ÄúInspiration and Ideas!‚Äù in your project plan and gather some concepts.
- [ ] **Brainstorming**: Complete the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Brainstorm‚Äù section.
- [ ] **Data Collection**: Fill in your favorite tracks in ‚ÄúCollect Song Data‚Äù.

## Lesson 2.2: Understanding Arrow Functions
**Objective**: Review and practice using arrow functions while getting familiar with the starter code.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Code Review**: Read through the provided HTML and JavaScript starter code.
- [ ] **Code Creation**: Declare variables for display divs.

## Lesson 2.3: Arrays & Indexes
**Objective**: Create arrays to store song data and start customizing the style of your playlist.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Data Structures**: Create arrays to store song data.
- [ ] **Style**: Apply any stylistic changes you planned in the previous brainstorming session. üòé

   _Considerations_: You might want to have an array for each data type: one for image URLs, one for song names, one for artists, and one for song links.

## Lesson 2.4: Introduction to Loops
**Objective**: Learn to manipulate arrays using loops and display song data.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Looping**: Loop through arrays using either `for`, `forEach`, or other loop structures and display song data.

  _Considerations_: Think about the type of HTML tags to use for your data and the div container to which you're displaying the data.

## Lesson 2.5: Array Properties & Methods
**Objective**: Get hands-on experience with array properties and methods.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Variables**: Declare variables to save the user input. You need four in total: image URLs, song names, artists, and song links.
- [ ] **Array Manipulation**: Use the `.push()` method to add the user input to the appropriate arrays.

## Lesson 2.6: Working with Objects
**Objective**: Refactor your data to use objects instead of arrays for better data management.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Refactor your data to use objects instead of arrays.

  _Considerations_:
  - Consider commenting out the array data to keep as a reference.
  - Each song should be represented as an object that has key/value pairs for: song name, artist, image URL, and song link.
  - Store all of the song objects in an array.
